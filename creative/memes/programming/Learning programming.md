How learning programming goes:

1. *You're trying and struggling to solve a problem with the knowledge that you already have. Eventually you give in and ask someone more experienced on the internet for advice*
2. *They show you a completely different approach to solving the problem and your perspective completely shifts and you enter the next dimension*
