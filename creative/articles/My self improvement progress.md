# My self improvement journey
## How it stared
I was probably around 15-16 when I first started seriously getting interested in self-improvement, discipline and being productive.

I remember reading countless Reddit posts and comments on subreddits like r/discipline and r/productivity about how to self improve.

I was fascinated with the topic. I was at the time quite disorganized in every aspect of my life. Recognizing this helped me to start my path towards self improvement and discipline.

At the time, I was mostly learning from Reddit. There were countless different advice and methods about how to achieve success in life. They were all useful, but most, not to me at that point in my life. One piece of advice struck out though. One that I had read over and over in various Reddit threads.

The advice was this - if you want to get something done, the only way to do it is to muster up the courage and just do it. You must go out of your comfort zone if you want to improve. To a lazy guy like me, who dreaded doing things that he didn't like doing, this was quite eye opening. I slowly started realizing that this is true - that it all comes down to having the willpower and just doing it.

There were some other useful pieces of advice, such as breaking tasks down into very small digestible steps, just showing up, positive thinking.

But 'just doing it', it was the foundation. The foundation upon which every method and approach rests.

I started exercising. I started brushing my teeth, showering. I started going out of my comfort zone and socializing.

Of course, when I first started out, it was mild. Most of the days I was still lazy and unproductive. But sometimes I would remember the notion of 'just doing it', and be able to commit to doing something, without relying on or hoping for 'feeling like doing it'.

## How it is now

Now I'm 25, and as I look back on the progress I have made towards being the person that I want to be, I am simply stunned. The progress that I have made, to me, is simply incredible. I have a well paying freelance job, I brush my teeth every day, I journal, I am able to (somewhat) commit to projects. I am able to socialize with people pretty well despite by anxiety. I am able to handle my schizophrenia very well.

Although there's definitely still room for improvement, I've come to understand some things about life and myself:

### Some things are learned only by experience

There are some things in life that you can't learn from a book or an article or a Reddit post. No matter how much you read or listen about it, it just won't 'click' that way. Some things will only click from your own introspection and experience. I've had a lot of such moments during my self improvement journey. Of course that is not to say that I could just disregard everything that I was taught by others. But some things simply need *you* to understand them.

### It's okay to give up, as long as you return to it one day

I've given up countless times during my journey. But each time, I would come back to it. I would keep persevering and trying again and again and again. Now I recognize that what I thought was 'giving up' was just me taking a break. It's important to understand when your energy, either mental or physical, is depleted and take appropriate rest. But remember to return to whatever your pursuing, stronger than before.

### Keep learning

Some things won't click the first time you learn about them. But that doesn't mean they should be disregarded as useless. Different pieces of knowledge and advice are appropriate for different situations and stages in life. So if something doesn't make sense to you or seems useless now, try again tomorrow, or in a week, or next year.

### Understand the power of habits

Habits are something that have a very big impact on your life. As you go along your discipline journey, you will learn how to form habits as well as how to break off bad habits/addictions.

### Do things that you enjoy

Sometimes you may get so caught up in trying to achieve self-perfection that you might forget why you're doing it in the first place. Always remember your 'why' and your values and live according to them. It's true that to improve you must go out of your comfort zone. But you don't have to do it all the time. Take some time to just enjoy life and hobbies and forget about improving for a while.

## Conclusion

Right now I'm trying out a new (old) productivity technique - scheduling/planning and time blocking. Before this I'd just have a todo list and do my todos throughout the day whenever I felt like it. But I've started to realize that a lot of my time goes into distractions. So I've decided to start scheduling and planning my activities in advance and time blocking them, with the goal to be more focused and less 'all over the place'.

I hope my story has inspired you in some way, and I wish you to live a wonderful, happy life.

Thank you for reading.
