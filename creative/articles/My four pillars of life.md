# My four pillars of life
I'm sure that many of us, myself included, have at some point Googled or browser the web to find some information on how to live life 'right', some kinds of methodologies or principles that would guide us towards having a balanced and fulfilling life. I've been such a person multiple times in my life. So today I decided to write a little about what I think would be my own basic principles and methodologies. I would like to talk about the four pillars of life.

*Disclaimer: although I am in support of these principles and think that they are a solid foundation, I must admit that I haven't yet fully incorporated them into my life, so take what I say with a grain of salt and apply your own perspective and interpretation*

So what are the four pillars? Basically, the four pillars of life are the 4 categories of your own self that together encompass every aspect of your being, be it physical, spiritual or mental.

Since they are pillars, pillars that your own self stands on, neither is more important than the other and an appropriate time should be devoted to each, and none should be left out or done in favor of any other, at least in the long term. In a short term context though, there are cases when one would be more important than the other.

So, the pillars:

* Sustenance - This includes your most basic needs that you require in order to be able to live at all - food, water, shelter, community.
* Health - This includes everything related to keeping your body, mind and spirit healthy. Things such as a healthy strong body, a strong, calm, put together mind, and a healthy spirituality (if you subscribe to such notions).
* Fun - This includes everything related to your interests, such as hobbies, side hustles and work (assuming that you enjoy your work, which I'd like to write a separate article on sometime).
* Relationships - This includes anything that involves not just you, but someone else. Things such as offering help to others, spending quality time with friends and family, being involved in the community.

Now, as I mentioned, all of these pillars are equally important and in the long term should not be prioritized. But in the short term, in the moment, one could be more important than another. For example, you absolutely can't have quality fun times or even work on your health, if you haven't eaten for 2 days. So in such a case your priority would absolutely be to find some food and not to run a jog.

But again, it is worth noting that they are still interdependent. You'd have a much better and easier time in sustaining yourself and your health, if you also devoted appropriate time to fun and relationships.
