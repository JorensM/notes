Do you want to hear the story about Jesus, 'the God who suffered?'

Basically, it all started with God being the only thing in existence with immense power and complete happiness and contentment. But not even God could escape the law of duality - happiness depanded the opposite to be able to exist. So God had to create a being of suffering, in order to fulfill the law of duality.

But there was something that God was able to do, and out of his love for everything, He did.

God decided to do a 50/50 split - he sacrificed half of his happiness in order that the being of suffering could experience that half.

This is what Jesus was, he was a sacrifice to mankind, an embodiement of God partially suffering, so that his creations could enjoy partial happiness.

The end.
