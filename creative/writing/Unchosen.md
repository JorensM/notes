**Unchosen**

Hi. I am an Angel. I can't speak for other Angels, but I myself, have never been chosen. You see, Angels usually reside here until they are chosen to be created and given a purpose. I have seen many of my friends get chosen, but I myself am yet to be.

Sometimes I wonder what lies beyound the veil where we go when we are chosen. I wonder what my friends who have been chosen are doing. I hope they are having fun.

In this place, I spend my time wondering about what my purpose would be if I were to be chosen. Would I be an artist? Would I be a builder? Would I be a boy or a girl?

I also wonder about this place and myself. What is this place? Why am I here, and how did I get here? It feels like I've always been here. I suppose that the fact that I lack a purpose suggests that me being here also has no reason or meaning.

I wonder if I'll ever be chosen. Oh well.

It was fun talking to you! I will return now to play with my friends, bye!
