I cannot change how I feel,
I cannot tell you what's real,
I cannot change what I do,
I can't tell you what's true.

I am nothing but,
A vessel, a carrier,
Transmitting myself, my soul.
But where does the data go?

And what is myself?
Where do I come from?
Do I come from anywhere?
Or have I always been?

I cannot change how I feel,
Why would I want to?
I'm content, I'm here,
Peace is in the dark, too.
