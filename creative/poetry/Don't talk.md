Don't talk,
When you should be yelling.
Don't walk.
When you should be running.

You might look,
At me and say,
"But J,
You're so quiet yourself

You're so shut,
You barely make a peep"
But you might be surprised,
At how loud silence can be.

Don't talk,
When you should be yelling.
Don't walk.
When you should be running.
