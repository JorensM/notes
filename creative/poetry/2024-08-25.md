What should I write,
What should I say?
Today I just might,
Go all the way.

Why would I go all in, though?
What's the reason, what for?
Is there an actual benefit?
Anything gained from it?

Perhaps I will unlock,
The key,
To contentment,
And peace.

And while I've been pondering
About what shall be said,
My verse count,
Has come to an end.
