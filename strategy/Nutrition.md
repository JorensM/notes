For gaining weight I need to consume 270-300g of carbs every day and 60-100g of fat and 20g of saturated fat. 0.6 grams of protein per kg of body weight. So around 30g for me.

Emphasis would be on protein and fat because I have to gain weight.

7 cups of water a day

Foods with fat:

- Chia seeds
- Flaxseeds (Linsēklas)
- Coconut oil
- Nuts (saturated fats - brazil nuts, indijas rieksti, macadamia)
* Nut butters (Peanut butter, nutella)
* Nut/seed bars

Foods with carbs:

* Wheat (bread etc.)
* Oats/grains (oatmeal etc.)
* Vegetables
* Fruit
* Dairy products (milk)
