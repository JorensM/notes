My Pixel Zen Plant ideas

## General ideas

Background shows day/morning/evening/night depending on time. Sun moves as time passes.

Different plants grow faster during certain periods of the day.

Plants must be watered every few hours. If they don't get watered they stop growing until watered again. The less watered they are, the slower they grow which encourages the player to water their plants regularly.

Fully growing a plant gives you xp. As you get more xp, you level up. With each level you unlock a set of new plants. Each pot has a separate level and xp to avoid "industrialization"

Each plant can have different soils. Some soils work better for some plants, but which ones is kept secret for the player to discover

Once a plant has been grown, it gets added to the Plant Book. The plant book is a collection of all player's fully grown plants.

Soil types: 
 * Dark soil
 * Light soil
 * Sand soil

With each level, in addition to plants, the player unlocks a pot with a unique appearance. Each plant can have a different pot. You can change the color of each pot.

Player can have 5 plants planted at a time.
