# Pixel Plant Devlog #2

Hi, thanks for checking out my devlog!

So in the previous version I launched the basic game. All you could do was water a single plant and watch it grow over the span of a minute.

In this version I have tweaked the game and added/changed the following features:

 * Accessibility - game is now completely playable by keyboard
 * 3 new plants - I've added 3 new unique plant types, with each taking progressively longer to grow
 * Unlock system - each time you fully grow a plant for the first time, you unlock a new plant type
 * Main menu - there is now a main menu with a couple of buttons
 * Collection - In your collection you can view all your unlocked and grown plant types
 * Pace option - If you feel like the game is too slow paced or too fast paced for you, you can now set the pace in the options to make the plants grow faster/slower
 * Added dividers for watering stages - so it might not be obvious when you're playing, but depending on how much water a plant has, it will grow faster or slower. This is divided into 'water_stages', where each stage has a different growth speed. In this version I have added dividers to the water bar so you can see which stage the water level is in
