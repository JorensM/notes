Thin pancakes recipe

 * 1 cup flour
 * 1 teaspoon sugar
 * 1 pinch salt
 * 2 eggs
 * 1 Â¼ cup milk
 * 1 tablespoon oil
 * butter (for the pan)
 

Whisk everything except the butter until you have a pancake batter that resembles the consistency of whipping cream.

**Make sure your pan is evenly nice and hot before you start cooking the pancakes**

Add on a bit of butter to the pan, and quickly swirl it around the pan. Then pour on the pancake batter and quickly swirl it around.

Cook for 30-45 seconds each side.

Once the first side is done, gently give the pan a shake to release the pancake, and carefully flip it.
