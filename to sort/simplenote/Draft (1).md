Draft
Hi, I'm a web developer looking to break into the game industry

What I bring to the table:
  * 4 years of programming experience
  * 1 year of non-professional game dev and design skills
  * 1 year of experience with Godot
  *  Strong communication
  *  20hrs/week worktime (at least at the start)

What I'm looking for:
  * Salary in the range of 25$/h - 30$/h
  * A game company with a clear vision and needs of users in mind instead of just money and fame.

Technologies I have worked with - 
   * JavaScript
   * TypeScript
   * PHP
   * Java
   * Goland
   * Gdscript
   * Godot
   * Phaser
   * Matter.js
   * Box2d
   * React
   * Node.js
   * Socket.IO

But I'm definitely willing to learn new ones and am a quick learner.

I'm okay with working for 15$/h for the trial period, but would like to be paid 25$/h once I have proven my worth.

Feel free to message me here on Reddit, or on Discord: jorensm

Thanks for reading!
