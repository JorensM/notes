Zwaard review
This is a very well made game. The gameplay is VERY fluid, ths art is beautiful, and the combat is very enjoyable and skill-based. 

The enemies are well made and can be challenging at times (in a good way). 

The storyline seems very interesting, though I didn't get to find out much during the demo.

There are some issues for me -
1. To me, dodging towards the cursor is unintuitive, I'd much better prefer to dodge whichever direction the character is facing/moving
2. The contrast between solid and non solid object is too low in my opinion - people with vision impairments would have some trouble distinguishing between a solid and non-solid
3. I'm not sure if there is supposed to be a message when you finish the demo, but at some point I couldn't continue playing because for the life of me couldn't find where to go further. I think there should be a bit clearer indication of the main path.

That being said, the game is great and depending on how much it costs I will certainly consider buying it.

My rating - 9/10
