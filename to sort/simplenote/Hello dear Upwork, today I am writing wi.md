Hello dear Upwork, today I am writing with an important request. 
 
Currently Upwork prohibits clients and freelancers to share any links before starting a contract. I believe that this benefits no-one, not even Upwork.
 
Below are some reasons why Upwork should allow pre-contract link sharing:
 
1. Often times when interviewing, it is absolutely necessary for me to get some more information about the project, and the only way to do it is by visiting other websites. For example when I'm interviewing, it is necessary for me to see the project's GitHub repo, and also I need to see the website in its current state to see what needs to be done and to possibly suggest improvements to the client. I'm sure other professions can also relate, as it is often necessary to evaluate a project's state before the contract has started

2. A freelancer usually must share their portfolio with the client. Oftentimes Upwork's portfolio system is not enough, for example when you must showcase interactive projects, so the only way is to share the freelancer's portfolio website

3. A lot of people prefer communication outside of Upwork and are more comfortable communicating on other platforms

I understand that Upwork wants to prevent payments outside the platform, and I'm assuming that this is the primary reason for banning pre-contract link sharing. But it is my sincere belief that most people will be honest and keep payments on the platform, regardless of this rule. Additionally I think that this rule doesn't prevent making payments outside the platform anyway - people will, and have found ways to overcome it.

Many thanks and I hope the Upwork team will read this and consider cancelling the pre-contract link sharing rule
