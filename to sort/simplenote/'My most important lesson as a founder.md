# 'My most important lesson as a founder' post analysis

* Focus on solving problems and not coming up with ideas. Ideas only have value if they solve a problem
* Ideas must be validated quickly, easily and cheaply. I should only take up to 2 weeks to validate/invalidate an idea and ideally cost 0$

**1. Lay out a target customer persona.** 

Write down your target customer's profile whose problem is being solved.

**2. Create an assumption chart**

An assumption is anything that you need for your product to succeed.

Create a chart with: 
    1. X axis being 'no evidence'/'evidence'. This axis tells how much evidence there is to back your assumption
    2. Y axis being 'not important'/'important'. This axis tells how important the assumption is for your product's success.

First 2 assumptions should always be 'Is my product actually solving a problem' and 'Are there already products out there that solve this problem'

The assumptions to take note of are the assumptions that are in the top left corner of the chart - important and having no evidence.

List these assumptions out and come up with questions for your target persona that will provide insights into answering these assumptions.

**3. Start reaching out to your target persona**

Connect with people who match your target persona's profile, preferably *directly* (not through promotion), for example through LinkedIn, tell them about what you're trying to learn more about (the problem) and ask them questions that would help provide evidence for your assumptions. Take notes about the answers that they provide.

**4. Analyze/review the responses**

Analyze the answers. If you see a specific trend forming, have gotten enough data to validate or invalidate an assumption, or see new topics popping up, etc, this means it is time to change/remove/add questions.

At this point you should have an idea about whether your idea has been validated or invalidated.

**5. Are you learning anything new**

At this point you should ask yourself if you are learning anything new from the interviews, and if no then you should either change your assumptions or the target persona.

**6. Next steps**

At this point you should have validated/invalidated your idea. If your idea has been invalidated, then you should stop pursuing it and move onto something else. If your idea has been validated, it's time to build and MVP to put your assumptions and data to test.
