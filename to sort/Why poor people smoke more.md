The theory is that since poor people often don't have enough money to properly feed themselves, they try to fill this sense of hunger with smoking.

My observations as I've been trying to quit smoking is that when I haven't smoked for longer than usual, I quickly get hungry and want to eat something. Arguably this 'additional' level of hunger is always there but it gets suppressed by smoking.
