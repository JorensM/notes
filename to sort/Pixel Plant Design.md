# Pixel Plant Design

Each plant grows at different pace and length.

Water plants regularly. If the plant is not watered, it stops growing.

Min plant growth length - 20 minutes
Max plant growth length - 7 days

Can only have 1 plant at a time

Each time you grow a plant, you unlock the next one

Once a plant has been unlocked, you can see it in the collection and read some stats/description. If a plant is unlocked but hasn't been grown yet, you can't read its description stats, and can't see its image (a question mark is shown instead)
