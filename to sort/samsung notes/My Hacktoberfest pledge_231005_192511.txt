Hi!

I've decided to join Hacktoberfest this year. Truth be told, I didn't even know about it up until about 2 months ago. I've been an active developer for some 4 years now, but somehow Hacktoberfest has passed by unnoticably until recently.

I am very passionate about coding and open-source, so an event dedicated purely to that certainly resonates with me, so I've decided to participate in it.

Why I'm participating
I'm passionate about coding and open source, but still haven't made any significant contributions to any open source projects (except feature requests and bug reports). Joining Hacktoberfest is a great initiative for me to get more involved with open source. Additionally this is a great learning opportunity.

The plan
My Hacktoberfest plan is as follows:

1. Find project/projects to contribute to
2. Contribute to them

Occasionally I'll be posting about my progress here on DEV. My first post will be about finding projects to contribute to.

So this is my Hacktoberfest pledge, thanks for reading!
