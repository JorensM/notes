I want to earn a lot of money
Because I want me and my family to live comfortably
Because I don't know why

I want to earn a lot of money
So I can save some up
So I can learn to be humble and modest
Because modesty is the goal
Because modesty leads to peace

I want to quit smoking
So I can be healthier
So I can feel better
So I can be at peace
