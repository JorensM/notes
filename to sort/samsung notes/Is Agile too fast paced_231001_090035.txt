Our time is a time when technology and products are changing and evolving more rapidly than ever before. As developers, we are often met with tight deadlines. This is especially true with Agile teams. One of the [principles of Agile is to deliver a working product as frequently as possible](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html), as told by the agile manifesto. Could this be a crutch though?

My proposal - Slowgile - which is exactly like Agile, but take any sprint and multiply its length by 2.
