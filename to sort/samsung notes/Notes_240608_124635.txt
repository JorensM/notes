Lost in the echoes of my own thoughts,
Or someone else's thoughts,
It's hard to tell the difference anymore

The difference between what is me and what is you,
Between what is and what is not

I long for friendship and love,
But yet I am afraid of it,
Because that supposedly comes
With its own set of problems

If I knew what I wanted,
I'd at least have something to move towards
But when I'm like this, 
What am I do to,
But to lie in bed and write poems that don't rhyme on my phone
