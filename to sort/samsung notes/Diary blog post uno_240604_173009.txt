Hello :)

Welcome to my public diary where I will share my mostly mundane life and sometimes my not-so-mundane thoughts.

I decided to start this diary because I read on Reddit how someone was looking for diary style blogs, which inspired me to start this one. Maybe the Redditor wasn't quite looking for a diary of a "schizophrenic", but I'll try to keep it as "normal" as possible.

So in my first post I'll tell you a bit about myself and my background.

My name is Jorens, I'm a web developer and my hobbies include coding, art, piano, writing and reading.

So this is it for my first post! Have a blessed day!
