Today I've decided to write something. I don't know why or what I'm writing, but I thought it could be relieving so I decided to do it.

I woke up 3 hours ago and before that had slept 22 hours. Didn't get anything done on my todo list yesterday since I was sleeping all day.

Let me write a poem.

Green leavery creeking in the meeks
I find peace in simplicity, like beaks.

Always this tension in me,
Always something to let go.
Will it ever leave me?
Will it ever be so?

I hear it being said that I should do what I want to do. But what do I want to do? I guess I just want to not feel exhausted. Then I'll be happy to do anything. There's lots of things I want to do, but it often feels tiring to do these things despite wanting to do them, so I don't do them. Other times I try to do these things even if I don't have the energy. I'm still unsure whether it's good to do that. When I do, I feel burned out but at least I find some peace in what I do. At least then, when I go to sleep I feel like I've done something that day.
