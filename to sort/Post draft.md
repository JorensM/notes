Post draft
Hi, thanks for checking out my post!

As a preface I'd like to say that this project is just a hobby project and I don't have any plans on monetizing it. Also I would like to say that I'm looking for someone who is not afraid of the project failing or not getting finished due to whatever reason.

I have a vague concept in mind - basically a mobile game where the player takes care of one/several plants. They have to do things like water them, change their soil, trim leaves etc. It's kind of an idle type of game, in the sense that it takes 1-30 (ish) days to grow a plant.

The game will initially be developed for Android with possibility of web and iOS in the future.

Today I have started working on a prototype, so far I don't have much to show, you can just click on a plant and it will advance into the next stage of growth haha. But I'll keep working on the prototype.

I'm looking for a pixel artist who can help me make the sprites for the plants in each stage of growth, also icons for stuff like watering can, soil bags, pots etc.
