# [REVSHARE] 1 marketer, 1 2D artist/animator and 1 music/sound fx composer needed to form a game dev team.

First of all, thank you for checking out this post.

Second, I'd like to say that I'm looking for people who accept the possibility of the project failing or the team falling apart due to various reasons. Additionally I'd like to say that I'm looking for people with at least an intermediate level of skill in their respective areas, as I'm intermediate myself so I think it would only be fair for all of us to be of the same skill level.

------------------

I'm looking for 3 people to form a 4 person game dev team. I have deliberately not decided on the idea of the game as I'd like for the entire team to participate in making this decision. The only requirements for the game are:

* 2D game
* Non horror
* Small-mid sized

**The roles:**

* **Marketer** - as a marketer, your role will be to manage the marketing of our game, promotion, contacting streamers, youtubers, social media presence.
* **Artist** - as an artist, your role will be to create art assets and animations for our game. You can be a pixel artist or any other type of artist
* **Music/sound fx composer** - as a composer, your role will be to create audio assets for our game, that is music and sound effects.

My role - **programmer**. As a programmer I will implement the game design, mechanics and levels according to our specifications for the game

Common responsibilities shared among all members will be:

* game design - the design of the game itself, the game loop and the mechanics
* level design - the design of levels for the game
* narrative/storywriting - the design and writing of the narrative for the game
* and anything else that an individual role doesn't cover

What you bring to the table:

* At least an intermediate level of experience in your respective field
* At least 4 hours/week of working on the game (but that's more of a guideline than a requirement)

What I bring to the table

* Intermediate level of experience in programming and game development(4 years of programming and 2 years of gamedev)
* At least 4 hours/week of working on the game.

**About the revshare**: If we get any revenue from our game, we will split our revenue 1/4 each.

Once we gather our team, first we'll decide on the genre, style and core concept of the game. Marketer will play a big role in this as they know what is in demand. Once we've decided on the game idea, we will start designing and prototyping the game. And after that just refining refining refining until we make a quality product.

Sorry this post was a bit lengthy, and thanks for taking your time to read it.
