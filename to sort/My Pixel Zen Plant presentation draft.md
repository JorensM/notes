## Game description

My Pixel Zen Plant is a mobile casual idle plant growing and cultivation game. The goal of the game is to take care of various plants by watering them, changing their soil, trimming their leaves and pruning their roots. Once the player grows one plant, he unlocks the seeds for another one and can then plant that one. The player can plant as many plants as they want at a time, but the focus is on having them plant and care for only few at a time.
