Decided to make a small reset and go back to the basics by drawing on small sheets and with simple shapes.

Don't underestimate the power of incremental grow and starting small. Making progress in many small steps has the power to eventually move mountains! This is one one the principles that has helped me get my life together and I live by it every day. If you ever feel like a task is too daunting, try to break it into small actionable steps. This way you can tackle each step one by one, and it will also allow you to measure your progress, which can give you the motivation to carry on.

With love, Jorens.
