# My Pixel Plant Devlog #2

Version 2 of My Pixel Plant is out! The update brings a couple of new features, most notably:

* Option where you can change the pace of the game
* 3 new plants
* Unlock system where growing a plant unlocks the next one
* Collection page where you can view and read about your unlocked plants
* Improved the design of the UI

I had tons of fun working on this update, and I think that, in contrast to the previous version, this one is at least somewhat playable!

In the next (and probably last) version I will add a few more plants. After that I'll probably call the game finished and stop working on it, except for the off-chance that the game blows up and people will want more features lol.

In the following days I will post a post where I explain the code architecture behind my game, so stay tuned for that!
