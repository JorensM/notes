# The making of Multiblogger

Hi dear readers!

Recently I launched my new app [Multiblogger](#TODO) into alpha. 

The app's concept is simple - it allows you to post and manage blog articles for multiple blogging platforms. Let's say that you're a blogger who blogs on [Dev.to](dev.to) and [Medium](medium.com) and you have a post that you would like to post to both platforms. Doing so manually sure works, but it can become cumbersome to manage the post (and even more so if you have multiple posts). For example, what if after publishing you found a spelling mistake or would like to update the posts with new information? You'd have to go through each post manually and update it on each platform. [Multiblogger](#TODO) solves this problem.

Mutliblogger allows you to easily post to multiple platforms simultaneously, and update the posts after publishing, from one place.

This article isn't a promotion of my app, instead I would like to talk about the app's design and its inner workings.

So let's dive in!
