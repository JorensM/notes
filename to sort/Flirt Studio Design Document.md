# Flirt Studio Design Document

Flirt Studio is a pixel graphics based sim game where the aim is to build characters and watch them go on dates with each other.

There is no 'win' condition to the game. You just build characters, match them with each other and watch them date.

## Character building

The following aspects of a character can be altered

### Appearance

# Dates

After having built 2 characters, you can have them go on a date. You can choose a date setting from a wide range of options, such as a restaurant, a cinema, or at one of the date's homes

During the date the characters will have conversations about random things, as well as their interests, personality and appearance.
