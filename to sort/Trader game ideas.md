# Trader game ideas

Events that affect travel speed, such as weather

Encounters during travel

Hiring guards to protect from bandits

Inventory size affects travel speed

Per character trading - instead of ambigously trading with the village as one, trade with individual characters that you find in the village. Each character has special items that they are willing to pay more for

Quests - characters and villages can give you quests such as 'deliver this' or 'find me this'

Illegal items for which you can get fined

Producing own products by owning/building workshops

Possibility to buy buildings that produce stuff or provide revenue

Caravan needs occasional repairing

Game should be made in such a way that the player spends little time traveling and more time in the villages

Team - have team members with gear.

Decision based dialogue and events which alter the game's behavior depending on choices made

Reputation system - complete quests to gain reputation. Completing a quest for one village may increase reputation in that village but lower it in another. High/low enough reputation enables specific events and dialogues

Skills - 
- bribing - how easy it is to bribe guards
- haggle - how easy it is to haggle
- stealth - how easy it is to be found by bandits/guards
- speed - how fast you travel

Events based on how far into the game you are to create sense of progression

At some point you form a company and hire traders that do the trading for you
