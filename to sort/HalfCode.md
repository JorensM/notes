# HalfCode

## Description
HalfCode is a half-code platform that empowers developers.

Use no-code with the addition of all the perks that comes with custom coding

In HalfCode, no-code is used for repetitive and simple-to-code tasks such as UI and simple functions, while custom code is used for parts where no-code would not excel, such as integrations with APIs and more advanced UIs.

The main focus and advantage of HalfCode is that it seamlessly bridges the gap between no-code and all-code - it allows you to use no-code where it is appropriate, while allowing for seamless custom-coded implementations in more complex cases.

## Features

**Drag & Drop and custom code**

Build your UI using a drag&drop builder, and add custom code to any element where needed. Attach event listeners to elements for any available event.

**Reusable components**

HalfCode uses React, which means that you can create reusable components, use state and pass props, all possible through a no-code interface while allowing for custom code in more complex cases.

**npm packages and exports/imports**

HalfCode adheres to ECMAScript, which means it has support for importing and exporting modules, which allows you to neatly organize your modules by files and import only what is necessary for a particular part of the code. Additionally HalfCode supports installing npm packages, so you can use any module that is available on the npm registry
