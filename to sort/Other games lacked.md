# Other games lacked

Can't search/filter inventory items

Lots of diversity in items is good, but they should have different functions

Little value in talking to an NPC more than once

Monotomy - just buying stuff, traveling then selling it. Needs something to liven up the gameplay loop

Should make the game equally difficult throughout the game, or increasingly easier - but not harder

Lacked sense of progression
