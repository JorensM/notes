Writing down notes. Tracking your life, habits, time

Tracking things helps you:

• put things into perspective

Writing things down helps you:

* Keep your mind and memory de-cluttered
* Remember things
* Keep your mind organized
* **Make your ideas, thoughts and memories accessible on-demand** - usually when we keep stuff in our heads, we can't really just recall or come up with something by choice/on-demand. When we write our thoughts down, we can check our notebook at any time and review those thoughts.
