If we equate money as a means to have shelter and food, can it really be a 'nice to have', or is it a necessity, and just as much of a basic need as anything else? I suppose, but just like shelter and food, it's not just a goal but also an indicator of success.

I could move to an unclaimed land and survive there without any money. But if money is an indicator, what's the point, it would just be the same wouldn't it? I doubt there is any unclaimed land anyway, except on other planets/systems maybe.

Alright, if money is an indicator, then saving money would theoretically work because if I am successful while possessing money but not spending it, then money should theoretically be an indicator.

How about just doing stuff without trying to earn any money? Money *could* be an indicator or a goal or whatever, but it might just as well be that the way towards it is by not pursuing it

But an important part of it seems to be to still do *something* with your life. Play piano, wash the dishes, code. But no money. I mean ultimately part of success seems to include not worrying about money, so why not start not worrying about money. If not worrying about money = success then not worrying about money = money if money = success.
