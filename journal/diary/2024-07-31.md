`10:45AM`

Good morning

Today I woke up kind of late, at around 9-10AM.

I've decided to take it more slowly and not worry too much about finishing my tasks - just work on stuff slowly at my own pace, and whatever gets done gets done, and whatever doesn't can be done another day.

I've also thought about how I've been talking too much. I don't know if people care or don't care about what I say, but from a personal standpoint it has gotten exhausting to talk so much and be sharing my thoughts etc. When I talk to people so much I feel like I'm not paying enough attention to myself and feel like I'm losing myself. So as a resolution I'll try to make an effort to listen more and talk less and only talk mostly when someone asks me something.

I've also thought about responsibility towards others. Is it my responsibility to do things for others without being asked, or should I only do things when I'm asked to do them. I'm leaning towards the latter, and I think I'll also start practicing that - not doing things for others unless being explicitly asked to.

Alright, now I'm off to work and probably will work until I'm done with today's tasks or until mom wakes up.

See ya!
