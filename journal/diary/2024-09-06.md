Hey there! Haven't written here in a while. I went through a 2 week rut but now I'm back to normal.

I will go have cofee with mom in a bit and then I'll probably work.

I've already fed Baley and brushed my teeth.

I've decided to start documenting my life a bit more.

It was a nice day. I'm heading off to bed now to read something a bit and then go to sleep. Tomorrow I'll be going to the store with mom pretty early in the morning.

Mom made some really cool copper wire earrings that we posted around SM, and someone on Reddit said that they want to buy them. We also made an Etsy listing.

In the evening mom made another pair of earrings out of aluminium which also look pretty cool. Tomorrow we could make another Etsy listing and also share these ones around.

Good night!
