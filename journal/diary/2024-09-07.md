Good day. Today I woke up at 10am and soon went to the store with mom, and we're back just recently. It was quite a trip, we made 9 stops.

First we stopped to check mom's apartament. It looks a bit messy but can be tidied up in a day or two probably. I'm considering trying out to live there for a bit, just to see what it's like. We also got some transparent sticky paper to lay on stickers so they don't wear out.

Then we went to a book store and bought a multi-compartment folder for me(pic below), some sticker paper for both of us, a notebook for me because I want to keep my diary there (lol), and some thin colored cardboard paper for mom's cards (for the earrings)

In around a week there will be a fair and I'll probably go to sell my prints and mom's earrings.

Then we went to a pharmacy, which was closed, so we went to another one nearby and bought some Citramon and Ibuprofen (painkillers).

Then we went to Top and bought cigs and something to eat because we hadn't eaten anything in the morning.

Then we went to grandma, talked a bit and ate the bulciņas and also shared some with her, then we smoked and went.

Next stop was Maxima where we bought coffee and a lighter for me since I'm out of lighters. She also got some milk snacks

Then we went to Viss Ğimenei where we bought shampoo and some beads for mom's jewelry.

After that we went to the meat store and mom bought some meat (not sure what kind).

Finally we went to Top and bought food and stuff and then we were on our way home. Mom also took 30 euros from the ATM - 20 for Daris for delivery of firewood, and 10 for milk from our neighbors.

So now we're home and I'm just chilling on my phone. I wanted to work a bit but decided not to, so that I don't burn myself out.
