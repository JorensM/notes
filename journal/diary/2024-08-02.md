Good evening.

Today I was mostly taking care of the bird (it turned out to be a housr martin and not a barn swallow, so it could've been a male too). We also released it today and it flew away. Maybe it will return, we'll see.

I worked too today for a bit. Hopefully I can get back into my routine.

Now I'll make my todo list for tomorrow, practice a bit of French and then go to bed.

Good night!
