6:40PM

Good evening, today was a good usual day.

I helped my mom on the field, moved a few roofs. 

Didn't have any work today though. 

Still learning French on Duolingo, I'm on a 17 day streak right now. I've also started taking notes on French to help me memorize, practice and rehearse.

I want to start cleaning up the new barn (that used to be a workshop) so we can keep Dalia and the chickens there. We have to get that done before the cold starts so we can keep them there during winter.

Had a quick drawing session before sleep, now I'll work on minitask for a bit and then head to bed and finish my Duolingo lessons to stay above the weekly goal. After that all my today's tasks will have been done and I'll be ready to head to bed.

Alright, that's it for today, have a good night!
