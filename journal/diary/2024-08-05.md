`12:30PM`

Good day.

I've taken a break from work until Tuesday or Wednesday (today is Monday). Having slow days lately and just trying to ground myself.

I have a suspicion that the bird we released got eaten.. I was walking in the forest around the area where I last saw it flying, and there were some feathers on the ground that had the same colors as the bird. Looked like a fight. Perhaps we shouldn't have released it so early.
