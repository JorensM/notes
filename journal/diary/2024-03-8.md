Good day.

Today I've decided to take it slow and only do my most important and base tasks/habits, such as brushing teeth, helping mom, walking the doggies and working. I will only do a single off-task that isn't habitual today. Maybe I may turn it into a routine to only do a single off-task per day.

Today I already brushed my teeth and did dishes with mom.

Now I'll go work, have a nice day!
