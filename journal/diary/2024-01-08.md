Good morning and good first day of the month.

Yesterday my mom found a [barn swallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_swallow). It has a broken leg but it can fly. It looks like it fell or crashed due to the strong wind, so for now we're keeping her (it's a girl, Saija told me that you can tell by its breast - males have an orange breast and females have a white one, and this one has a white one) at least until the wind calms down. She is able to fly but the wind is just too strong. Right now she's here beside me in a box. I've been giving her water and some dried up insects that were by my window. Mom also got her some worms. Barn swallows have a strictly 100% insect diet. She does drink water but she doesn't seem to be eating too much.

Today I'll keep doing my usual routine as always.

I'll start off by doing my short programming lesson on the Books Bears Read Discord server. 

After that I'll work for a bit, and after that I don't know yet.

My mom also asked me to go to the store today. I don't have a lot of money (only 14 eur) but I do have 140 euros in savings. But we'll try to budget.

Alright, I'll be going now, have a nice day!
