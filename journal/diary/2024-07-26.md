Good morning. I've set up Obsidian on my computer. I want to start using it on my phone too. I'd like to store my notes on GitHub, but it seems that git is slow on mobile (although I don't have that many files so it should be fine).

Obsidian looks pretty cool.

2:40PM

I was on the field and got one row done. Also just finished a small task I got at work. Now I'm just waiting for mom to come home from the store. I had Greek salad for lunch that I made myself. Too much cheese but it was still alright.
