Good afternoon.

Today I haven't done anything much, I'm on a small break. Tomorrow I'll probably start working again and possibly all the other stuff I usually do.

I want to express myself but I don't know what I want to say. I guess it comes from the uncertainty that I'm experiencing towards everything, including myself. Perhaps I can express that, though.

If I were to start freewriting, what would I write? A story? A poem? A research paper? There's many formats in which I can write, but at the same time it feels like none of them, at least the ones that I know of, are appropriate for what I want to express. I guess, some sort of a philosophical essay, perhaps? I guess I'll try that.

I just wanna do something, I don't wanna sit idly in place, at least not right now. Mostly I want to create. Be it art, music, writing, or something more technical like coding.

I had read on a poetry subreddit that what makes a poem 'good' at least somewhat objectively, is the craftsmanship behind it. They explained that amateur poets share their feelings, while more experienced ones go beyond that and 'play with words' to create something amusing. I want to write such poems too, but something is stopping me from doing that, so I resort to writing about my thoughts and experienced, not focusing on the 'craftsmanship' too much.

I suppose I'll give a try to writing a philosophical essay now.

Have a good afternoon!
