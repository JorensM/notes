Good morning.

Today is really windy, and it also rained a lot all night. But it's nice and the breeze is cool on my skin.

I went to sleep very early yesterday, around 5-6PM because I hadn't slept much the night before. Today I woke up at around 8AM.

I've already helped my mom move a few of the hay blocks to the barn.

Today I'll do my usual stuff according to my todo list and schedule. Haven't received any tasks at work in a few days but maybe that'll change.

I'm thinking of decreasing my daily workload of tasks and limit it to 1 chore for mom per day, as I'm starting to feel a bit burned out from all the rushing. I'd rather take it at a slow pace and also have some time left in the day for me time as well.

Now I'm off to doing my tasks, starting with a few Duolingo exercises.

See ya!
