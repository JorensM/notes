# What is an essay and how to write one

An essay is a concise piece of writing aiming to inform the readers about a particular topic or argue a particular position. An essay can be both formal and informal, which largely depends on the context in which it is being presented. For example academic essays are usually highly formal, whereas more personal essays such as journal entries or blog posts tend to be informal.

An essay can be written about absolutely any topic.

## How long is an essay?

An essay's length typically falls somewhere between 500-5000 words. Again, it often depends on the context in which it is being presented. That being said this isn't a hard rule, and writing 5001 won't suddenly make your writing not any essay anymore. In fact, there have been book-length essays written as well.

## Structure of an essay

Typically, an essay has a single introduction paragraph, multiple body paragraphs and a conclusion paragraph. But that too is not a strict rule and you may omit some paragraphs or, for example, have two introduction paragraphs.

1. **Arrangement of information** - Arrange information in your essay in such a way that the simple things come before the more complicated things. Start your essay off with general statement/statements and then move on to the specifics. (Fun fact, in UX design, this is called [Progressive Disclosure](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/what-is-progressive-disclosure/))
2.  **Provide context** - Provide background information required to fully grasp your thesis statement[^1]
3. **Select appropriate topics** - Select appropriate topics and statements that clearly support your thesis statement
