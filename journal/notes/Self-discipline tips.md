*This is a comment I posted on Reddit recently, responding to a person who was asking for 
help in getting disciplined. I think it was quite well written with some good advice so I decided to save it here.*

> Not a method but more of several realizations -
> 
> the realization that as long as I don't do anything, nothing will change, and the realization the only way to accomplish something is to do it. You can devise all the elaborate schemes and strategies and methods in your mind, but they are merely tools that won't amount to anything if you don't actually put effort into accomplishing what you want to accomplish.
> 
> The realization that progress takes time and is achieved with a long series of very small steps. You won't be able to change much overnight but you won't believe how much you can change if you keep at it for weeks, months.
> 
> The realization that the way you choose to think and perceive things has a huge effect on your motivation and well being. If you encourage yourself and others, forgive yourself and others, express gratitude for what you have and celebrate every small victory, you will have a much easier and fun time.
> 
> The realization that I won't be able to do everything I want to do within my lifetime, which has made me set my priorities straight and devote my time to things that truly matter to me.
> 
> The realization that some things are out of my control, but also that some things are in my control.
> 
> The realization that taking breaks and resting and having lazy days are important and also inevitable.
> 
> The realization you can't always change people. You can help them change if they're willing to be helped and willing to change, but ultimately it's up to them.
> 
> The realization that I can't and shouldn't depend my happiness on other people or the future or any other external factors, and that I should be content and grateful for what I have right now.
> 
> The realization that an occasional failure/mistake is inevitable and should be treated as a learning experience and stepping stone to become better.
> 
> There's probably more realizations but the ones above are the basic ones that are quite foundational to me.
> 
> But what I'm trying to get at it is - the biggest transformations won't come from finding some perfect magic method on the internet, they will come from foundational shifts in your understanding and perception of the world and yourself, from deep sessions of introspection. These realizations often come naturally with time as you gain life experience, because to truly 'realize' it you have to believe it, and just reading about it on the internet is rarely enough to believe it, you have to ponder about it deeply and understand it yourself, you have to learn what is good and right for you personally, because everyone's journey is different.

> I had read a lot about discipline and self-improvement in my teens but I feel like it really started to click only later in my life, when my mind matured and came to the conclusions itself, by thinking a lot about things like 'who am I?', 'what do I want to achieve?', 'what are my values?'. Though I'm not disregarding the effort I had put into learning discipline when I was a teen, as at that point I was affirming my desire to become better which was also a contributing factor. So if you're young that doesn't mean you should stop learning to be better, but understand that the internet and people can only be your guides and advisors, true transformations happen from within.

> To answer your edit: it does get easier, at least it has for me. I have learned to enjoy mundane tasks like work and chores and doing dishes, but this enjoyment comes not from the end goal that I may achieve by doing these tasks, but rather from the very act of doing these tasks. If I don't enjoy doing something I simply won't do it, and I think that doing things for the sake of achieving something in the future is unsustainable, as you will always feel obliged and pressured to do things which can lead to stress.
