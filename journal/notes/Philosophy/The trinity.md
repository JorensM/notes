Here's what I've been thinking about lately

First there was a thing, what kind of a thing it was, I'm not sure, but probably either nothing or everything

After a while, another thing occured. It was the polar opposite of the first thing

Thing 1 and thing 2 started clashing

From the conflict of the 2 things, a third thing became at the border where the first two meet

This third thing posesses the qualities of the first two

One of the first two things is also the third thing, because it is everything

But the other of the first two things is neither of the other, because it is nothing

One of the first things is nothing. And the other is everything. And the third thing is anything

Nothing is nothing at all. Everything is everything, including nothing and anything. And anything is well, anything. It might be just solely nothing, it could be solely everything, it could be something but not necessarily completely everything nor completely nothing.

Anything is a bridge that holds everything  together and in balance, and also a doorway into other possibilities, other than everything and nothing.
