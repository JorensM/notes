# Basics of business

## Marketing and branding

Marketing helps customers find your product/company and a reason to buy your product. One of the most effective ways to understand marketing is to learn your customer's decision-making steps/logic and relate that to various marketing techniques

## Finance management

A company should track every single piece of income and expense in detail. In startups, this is largely related to attaining funding, such as investments, crowdfundings, loans. A company should also predict future incomes/expenses and plan how to use attained funds.

## Accounting

Accounting is related to finance management, but it is more related to regular business expenses/incomes.

## Business strategy

A company should have a strategy/plan by which to act. In the early stages of a company, this largely entails creating a business plan, which outlines the goals of the business and steps towards achieving them. But strategy remains important throughout all of the stages of a business, and it's worth rehearsing or updating the business plan once in a while.

## Research and development

Research and development includes researching the potential market and competition of a product before proceeding with its creation, as well as the creation of the product itself. Research should be still done after the release of the product.

## Staff management

Companies should manage their employees well, make sure that they work in a healthy environment, are well, and that they clearly understand the goals of the company and the tasks at hand.

## Legal considerations

It's important to consider all the legal aspects of your business; attaining necessary licenses, adhering to law and regulations. It can also include the contracts that you enter with your employees, clients or business partners.

## Vendor management

If your business has vendors that it buys supplies from, you should understand how to work with them. Consider learning about how to choose a vendor, the costs, potential contract terms and how to build healthy successful long-term relationships with vendors.

## Networking

Networking entails communicating with your business peers to share knowledge and experience and for potential collaborations. Networking can lead to your contacts sharing your product or company with potential clients. It may also lead to new opportunities to work with new vendors, attend events and meet more experienced professionals who can advise you.
