# How to start a business

## Before starting

Before starting your business, you should research and develop your basic business idea

### Idea

#### Coming up with an idea

Some ways to come up with an idea include:

 * Evaluating your skills and seeing if any of that can be used in business
 * Find gaps in the market that need fulfilling
 * Seeing your personal problems that you might want to solve, and seeing if solutions for these can be turned into a marketable product. If you face a problem, chances are, others have or are also facing it.
 * Take something that has already been made, and add your own spin to it

 #### Developing the idea

 Once you found an idea, take time to refine it, and research whether the idea is viable/necessary

 * Conduct market research to see if there is demand for your idea
 * Brainstorm your idea with your friends
 * Think whether the idea can take advantage of new technology
 * Consider whether social trends might affect the demand for your product
