The declensions of adjectives in French follow a fairly simple and predictable pattern.

* Masculine singular doesn't change the adjective at all
* Masculine plural appends an -s to the end of the adjective
* Feminine singular appends an -e to the end of the adjective
* Feminine plural appends -es to the end of the adjective

Below are some examples:

| | Singular | Plural |
| - | - | - |
| **Masculine** | intelligent | intelligents
| **Feminine** | intelligente | intelligentes

| | Singular | Plural |
| - | - | - |
| **Masculine** | amusant | amusants
| **Feminine** | amusante | amusantes

## Possessive adjectives

Possessive adjectives are adjectives that describe what or whom something or someone belongs to. These are words like 'my', 'your', 'their'.

In French, the form of a possessive adjective changes depending on the gender and plural/singular form of the noun that it is referring to.

For example, to say 'my dad', you would say 'mon père', whereas for 'my mom' you would say 'ma mère', and for 'my parents' you would say 'mes parents'.

Below is a full chart of all possessive adjectives and their forms

| English | Masculine | Feminine | Plural |
| - | - | - | - |
| My | Mon | Ma | Mes |
| Your (informal) | Ton | Ta | Tes |
| His, her | Son | Sa | Ses |
| Our | Notre | Notre | Nos |
| Your (plural of formal) | Votre | Votre | Vos |
| Their | Leur | Leur | Leurs |

### Exceptions

An exception to possessive adjective forms is when a singular noun starts with a vowel, in which case regardless of its gender, you use the masculine form to refer to it.

For example to say 'my (female) friend', you would say 'Mon amie' instead of 'Ma amie', even though 'amie' is feminine.

### Examples

> C'est mon frère Andrew. - this is my brother Andrew.
> Où est ta sœur? - where is your sister?
> Ce sont nos animals de compagnie. - These are our pets.
