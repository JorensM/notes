The declensions of adjectives in French follow a fairly simple and predictable pattern.

* Masculine singular doesn't change the adjective at all
* Masculine plural appends an -s to the end of the adjective
* Feminine singular appends an -e to the end of the adjective
* Feminine plural appends -es to the end of the adjective

Below are some examples:

| | Singular | Plural |
| - | - | - |
| **Masculine** | intelligent | intelligents
| **Feminine** | intelligente | intelligentes

| | Singular | Plural |
| - | - | - |
| **Masculine** | amusant | amusants
| **Feminine** | amusante | amusantes

---

Intelligent - intelligent

> Il est trÃ¨s intelligent - he is very intelligent.

Amusant - funny, fun.

> Je suis amusant - I am funny

Content - happy.

> Vous es content? - Are you happy?
