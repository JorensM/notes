Decentralized stock/crypto market.

Different model from traditional stock markets.

Focus is on long term investment. Stock prices update less frequently than in a regular market (say, once a week or once a month). But ultimately since the nodes are hosted by stock distributors themselves, they can configure them however they like.

Company sets up a stock node/network, and registers its stocks (just on the network).
