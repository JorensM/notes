No need for a server or even a blockchain: just wallets. Or maybe just a ledger server without excessive database or computation

  

Three most important parts:

Minting,

Validating,

Transferring.

  

If we do it the monopoly way, we don't need any type of security or validation because it's, well, monopoly currency.

  

Scarcity isn't the only thing that necessarily makes a currency valuable. It is also integrity. Belonging to a particular network and being fraud-resistant. And also, and probably most importantly - utility. Being useful.

  

As such, we don't need to make the currency scarce. Anyone can mint as much as they like. But the process of minting has to be standardized and the integrity of the coin needs to be validate-able, and the coin needs to be useful.

  

What is integrity? And how do we ensure it?

  

Integrity means that we can securely and confidently verify the belonging of a coin to a given network.

  

The integrity process happens during minting, where the algorithm that makes the coin integral, lies.

  

Wallet > mints coin

  

How do we make a monopoly coin useful?

  

If a coin can just be copied over, then perhaps we can have different kinds of coins, and the aim would be to collect them. But what's the utility? What's the difference between having collected 1 coin or 5 coins? Perhaps they can act as badges or identity/integrity checks that can give the wallet holder access to some things.

An offline wallet.

Utility with just a single wallet.

  

A personal currency.

  

A way to universally quantify monetary value.

  

1 dollar = 0.85 euro

  

1 gold = 3,777 dollars

  

1 gold = 3,228 euro = 3,777 dollars

  

......

  

Utility with just a single wallet.

  

Wallet: 0 coins

  

How do we mint?

  

We can 'deposit' regular currency or other crypto, as a bank or a proof of value.

  

1 dollar > Wallet > 1 coin

  

We can just mint it freely like monopoly money. What would be the utility?

  

Wallet > mint > 1 coin in wallet.

  

What can we do with this coin? With just a single wallet.

  

Or perhaps, just a single user. And we can have as many wallets as we need.

  

How about a reward based wallet? You can give yourself tasks, and when you complete them you receive coins, which you can exchange for currency (that you have yourself).

  

LockCoin: a wallet that allows you to temporarily lock your funds.

  

timestamp (unlock date) + key + amount = token

  

How do you store/convert external currency to our coin?
