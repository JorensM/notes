A plastic cup with 10 (or so) small on/off flips/switches to help you track your daily intake.

Every time you finish a cup, you can flip a switch which helps you keep track of your daily liquid intake

Alternatively it can be a cup pad so you can use your own cups.

Another idea is to use the small digital finger-counters (can be found on temu)
