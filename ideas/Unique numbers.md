# Unique numbers

Unique numbers is a potential math concept.

The exact definitions and rules are not yet clear, but general concepts revolving around this idea are: non-repeatability, non-duplicity, differentiation between equality and equality of value.

Consider this basic expression:

`1 = 1`

This expression states that one is equal to one. But if we get picky about the phrasing, and depending on how we define things, that is not necessarily entirely correct. It would be more approriate to say that the value of one is equal to the value of one. But the left hand of the expression is not necessarily exactly the same as the right hand, despite having the right value.

Consider this formula:

`x = y`;

In this case, x could potentially be a different expression from y, but despite that they will have the same value.

To get to the bottom of this, the proposal is to differentiate between equality and equality of value, and introduce the concept of a unique number.

A unique number is such a number or an expression that occurs only once in a given expression or formula.

A unique number could be denoted as x| where x is the unique number.
