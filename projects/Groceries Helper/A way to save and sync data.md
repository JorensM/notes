My user requested to be able to save and sync data across devices.

I want to keep the expenses to the minimum so if possible I would like for this to be done without a server.

Ideas:

* good old server with a database - simple, easy but expensive
* cloud drives - let the user store their data on their cloud drive such as Google Drive
