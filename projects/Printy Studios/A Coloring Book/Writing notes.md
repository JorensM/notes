Now that I have my pages, I can start writing.

Each page will be one-sided. The pattern will be textpage-drawingpage- textpage-drawingpage

I will start my book with the words 'At first, there was stillness' for the first page, followed by the parallel lines drawing

The last page will be left blank, with the words

'Now, it's your turn. Create :)'
