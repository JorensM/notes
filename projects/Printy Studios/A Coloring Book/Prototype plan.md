# Prototype 

This plan outlines the steps that shall be taken to develop the prototype of the book.

Each page should have a drawing only on one side, so the user can tear it out for personal use.

Each page should have creases so the page can easily be torn out.

Consider using thicker paper than A4 so that markers can be used for coloring.

The book should be oriented horizontally

 1. Draw out the pages. Estimate is 32-50 pages.
 2. Decide on the texts. Poetry? Writing? A mix?
 3. Decide on the structure and layout of the pages. Where should the text go?
 4. Write out the texts.
 5. Combine the text and the pages into the correct layout and save all the pages as a printable PDF that can be printed for the book
 6. Prototype the book cover and its design
 7. Print out the pages and create a book cover and create the book
