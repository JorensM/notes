# Prototype 

This plan outlines the steps that shall be taken to develop the prototype of the book.

Each page should have a drawing only on one side, so the user can tear it out for personal use.

Each page should have creases so the page can easily be torn out.

Consider using thicker paper than A4 so that markers can be used for coloring.

 1. Draw out the pages. Estimate is 32-50 pages
