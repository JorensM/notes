# Survival Mode

Sometimes we aren't feeling safe. We feel threatened, or feeling like
we lack something essential for being able to carry on. Feeling
like we aren't receiving the support we need or that those around
us have turned their backs on us.

Perspective shifts from "What is good for me in the long term?" or
"What is a nice to have in my life?" towards "What do I need in this very moment to be able to carry on?" and "Which weights can I drop?".

It stops being a slow-paced turn-based board game, where you have
plenty of time to think out your moves, and turns
into a realtime action game where every decision and every second
spent thinking on it counts.

In such situations one can lose sight of what's important. What used
to be a mere notification on the phone becomes a redundant distraction
costing one one's time and energy. Chit-chatters become time-wasters.
Funny videos on social media stop being so funny and become gravitational vortexes 
that you have to keep pulling yourself out from. 
Analysis paralysis might set in and one might have trouble deciding on the next move.

What do we do in such cases?

First of all, take a deep breath and take a step back. Understand
the difference between - aimlessly trying - and strategically taking calculated
steps with (at least some) certainty of them leading somewhere.

Look at the things you're doing right now or the systems you have in place,
and analyze to see which of them work and which don't, how you could make them
more efficient or effective. Which of them are redundant or dragging you down?

Time and energy are of the most cruicial resources, and the ones that are likely scarce.

If your body cannot receive all that it needs, that will be reflected in your energy levels.

Be mindful of where you put your time and energy, treat them economically and use them
where it pays off and where you can regain them. 

Rest is important. Conserve energy. Do not push yourself beyond what you're capable
of, let your body rest when it feels like and work when it feels like, and let it
naturally develop a sleep schedule that suits it given the situation. At times when
instinct takes over, let yourself act upon it, don't try to reason yourself out of
your instincts, but let your rational mind emerge when it does, and learn from it.

Throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks is fine, and can work out,
granted that one can afford it, but usually should done with at least some degree
of certainty or initial hypothesis. Typically though, if possible, it's better to stick
to what you know works.

Some say that surviving isn't just something you do when you're at the low end. But rather
that it's an entire philosophy/methodology that carries on after you've passed the
bar of "trying to scrape by", something you practice even when you're safe, and arguably a foundation upon which acquired security rests.
