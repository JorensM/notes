Oftentimes I might start working on a task and get carried away with it, completely forgetting that I have other tasks/responsibilities, instead of keeping a balance and working with my time limitations.

Strategy:

// List out tasks/habits I need to do in a day/week/month (which includes everything including // chores or eating etc.) , and order them by priority (highest - most important).
