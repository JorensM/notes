Like sheep we are lead,
Down below and down low,
We eat, but are we fed?
Or is our fullness just hollow?

We feast and then we celebrate,
While our world tumbles down,
We feed, but is that relevant,
When our words sink and drown.

Sleepy hollow people,
Living in their sheltered homes.
But beyond the peephole,
Take on different roles.

Just moving along,
Work, party, crash, repeat.
Here we belong?
That's all we mean to be?
