I'm just typing out what's on my mind
Never looking back at any line
Going forward and thinking ahead
Cause that's how life works, Mohammed

Shit, I'm improvising but it's not working out
I am so lost I wish I could shout
But hey, you know you can't say improv
Without saying improvement.
So I just keep paving this pavement of success
Made of my many failures, many long gone
And many many more to come.

Maybe when I've finished
I'll finally feel at home
Where there's no pressure of what I do
No consequences and no restrictions to who
I say what or why too.

This is quite fun, freestyling my poetry
Sometimes I make a typo, and I wanna leave it be,
But I can't, grammar mistakes are something I hate
And wish to eradicate
Because far too many people are not educate
Oops, I forgot the 'D'
But I got one down here
If you know what I mean.

Okay that joke was just mean
I'm better than that, I'm better than everyone
Including mister Bean.

lol lol lol
I've almost reached my toll,
Actually I lied, oh what a troll

Am I right guys?
I feel like I'm in the wrong company
Always wearing a mask,
A disguise

I wish I could find people
Who I can share thoughts with
And not just stare at through a peephole.

Hahaha
Peephole
Is it the hole you pee through?
It's not, but it does sound funny though.

It's called mind because it's mine.

My dick ain't easy to play with, ya retard.
You know why? Because it's hard.
