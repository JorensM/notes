```
Another day, another poem
About my uncertainty
About what I think or feel,
Or at least believe to.

I restrospect
On my past and where I am
To see that the progress is there
And that I'm getting better
What else to say.

I retrospect
On the memories
That I may or may not have
To see that what I was
Is not what I am

Yet my past
Has made me exactly who I am
So I can't just let go of it ungratefully
I want to thank it for the person it has made me,
Or rather, the person it has made me not.
