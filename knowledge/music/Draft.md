[Sheet music for beginners](https://makingmusicfun.net/htm/printit_piano_sheet_music_index) - it has tons of sheet music with simple folk songs as well as classics. I started with level 1 and then upped my level every 1-3 songs I learned. There's also sheet music there for other instruments

[Music theory free e-book](https://musictheory.pugetsound.edu/mt21c/MusicTheory.html) - this was my main learning source for music theory and I found it to be very good.

[Music theory and exercises](https://www.musictheory.net/) - there's both lessons and exercises here but I found the lessons to be a bit hard lacking, but the exercises are really good and randomly generated so you won't run out of them.

Once you've got past level 3 in the first link, you can start learning longer and more advanced songs on an app called Musescore - it has sheet music for all popular songs, both modern and old.
