The Crystal Quest Pitch Draft

# The Crystal Quest

The Crystal Quest is a 2D adventure platformer focusing on story, lore and interactivity with the world.

One morning you receive a letter from an unknown sender stating that you must find 10 magical crystals scattered across the world. So you embard on a journey to find them all.

The game is heavily focused on interactivity with the world around you. You can pick up flowers from the gound, you can watch TV, you can climb a tree, hide in the bushes, to name a few things. The side-interactions and lore will be so captivating that the main quest will almost feel like a side quest.

# Style

The game's artstyle will be mellow and cheerful pixel-art, similar to that of Stardew Valley (but in 2D platformer perspective) in the emotions that it evokes. The music will also be of the same style, in the form of retro 8-bit.
