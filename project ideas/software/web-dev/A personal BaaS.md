# Personal BaaS

As a developer, I always try to minimize the costs and technical requirements when creating an app. As such, I try to avoid using a backend when possible. But it is rare to be able to create an app without any backend.

Personal BaaS would solve this issue. Personal BaaS is a database that exists per-user, that the user owns completely. When creating an app, you don't have to create  and host your own backend/database, instead you can use the personal database of the user. Think cloud storage like Google Drive, but tailored more specifically for holding user app/website data
