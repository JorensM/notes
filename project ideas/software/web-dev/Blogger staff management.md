# Blogger staff management

Blogstaff is a staff management tool for bloggers that allows you to hire and manage writers and freelancers.

## For Bloggers

* Bloggers will be able to create an account from which they will be able to manage staff for a single or multiple blogs, each with their own dashboard. 
* **Tasks.** Bloggers will be able to create tasks and assign them to freelancers, specifying the following information:
  * What type of a freelancer is required for the task, for example a writer or a photographer
  * What needs to be done
  * (Optional) The deadline for the task
  * How much the blogger are willing to pay for the task
  * (Optional) Milestones
  * (Optional) Other requirements for the task, such as needed equipment or specific skills
  * (Optional) Additional information that could be useful to the *blogger*(not the worker), such as costs involved, expected ROI, etc.
   * (Optional) Schedule the task for a later date
* **Browse Freelancers.** Bloggers will be able to browse through a catalogue of freelancers who have registered on the platform. They will be able to view their portfolios and reviews
* **Job Postings.** Bloggers will be able to post their created tasks as jobs on a jobs board, which the freelancers can then view and apply to
* **Communication.** Bloggers will be able to communicate with freelancers using the built-in chat system.
* **Analytics.** Bloggers will be able to view analytics of their tasks and freelancers, with data such as time taken to complete the task and quality of work.

## For Freelancers

* Freelancers will be able to create an account in order to connect with bloggers, take on tasks and receive reviews.
* **Profile.** Freelancers will be able to customize their profile by showcasing their past work, reviews, rates and availability.
* **Job Search.** Freelancers will be able to browse job postings and apply to them, and set notifications for jobs relevant to them.
* **Feedback.** Freelancers will be able to receive feedback and reviews from bloggers, building their credibility on the platform.

The task flow is as follows:

1. Create a task, specifying details such as:

  All the data for all the tasks will be sortable/filterable.
2. Find a writer/freelancer by searching through the available freelancers list and contacting them or by posting the task on the jobs board, or by finding a freelancer outside the platform
3. Once a freelancer has taken a task, they can update on their progress through chat or by completing milestones.
4. Once the freelancer completes a task, the manager pays the agreed upon sum and optionally leaves a review/recommendation.

## Benefits

* **Efficiency.** The platform streamlines the process of hiring and managing freelancers, saving blog owners time and effort.
* **Access to curated talent.** The platform provides bloggers access to highly skilled freelancers that the bloggers themselves have curated through reviews and ratings
* **Cost-effectiveness.** By efficiently managing their freelancers and tasks, bloggers can optimize their outsorcing budget and maximize their ROI.
 
## Notes

The main purpose of the platform is to make it easier and less tedious for bloggers to manage their staff. Current ideas for the platform revolve around creating and managing tasks, but it doesn't have to be limited to that - I'm open to suggestions!
