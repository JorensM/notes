There once was a boy.
He wanted things. He wanted toys to play with, parents to take care of him, friends.
But he had none of that. In fact, he had nothing at all.
All he had was a void, just blackness. And a sense of lack of all the things that
he wanted. The lack, it stung like hunger, like an empty, growling stomach.

He made up stories and beings in his mind, because really all he had was that - his mind, and there wasn't really anything better to do. Some of these beings told him that he may receive the things that he wants under the condition that he stops wanting them. Whether it was just his own wish or if there was any weight to what they were telling him, is not really known, but that's what he did, or maybe pursued, or maybe it happened naturally over time. He lost his desires and wants.

He didn't really get the things that he wanted, but at least now he doesn't want them anymore, so I suppose it doesn't really matter.

Although, perhaps, he did get those things, but out of his new indifference towards them he just fails to notice it. He did get *some* things, after all. It's not exactly what he asked for, but these things were still pretty nice, even if there was no more desire.
